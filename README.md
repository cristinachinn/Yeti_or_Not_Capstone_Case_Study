Case study: Where is the best area to open up a Bigfoot tour company?
 
Introduction
In this case study, we will be evaluating multiple datasets in order to help an established U.S. tour company decide where to locate a new division of their company, titled Yeti or Not. I will be following the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. 

Scenario
Ghost Adventures runs a successful ghost tour company in multiple cities throughout the Southern United States. They want to open a tour company that takes tourists out to find traces of Bigfoot and hopefully discover the big creature itself. They would like us to use historical data to discover where the most frequent sightings are, and also determine which seasons would be best as they don’t wish to initially operate year-round.

Ask
Ghost Adventures asks you to analyze public datasets to discover which states have numerous reported Bigfoot sightings. They would like you to further investigate what month the sighting took place to gain insight into Bigfoot activity.
